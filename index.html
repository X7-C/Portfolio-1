                <h1>First JSCode!</h1>
                <p>This is my first ever project where I was messing around with JS code.</p>
                <p>This was a huge learning curve from what we're normally used to. However, conquered not so easily but fairly.</p>
                <p>This Project used mainly only JS and HTML hense 0 styling.</p>

                <h1>Semester Project</h1>
                <p>This was the first project of mine that I was assigned to create a functional website of pure HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>It was a successful project and an amazing experience.</p>
                <p>I am very interested in future CSS that ill be able to learn as I keep going with this and possibly even Bootstraps.</p>

                <p>First combination of the three main languages we've been studying.</p>
                <p>Can't say it was easy, however managed to pull through somehow. Didn't finish it sadly, but there's always second chances.
                    The goal will be that I will finish that website with beautiful CSS and working JavaScript.

                <p>Yes</p>
